# üõ°Ô∏è Network Anomaly Detection for Critical Infrastructure

A lightweight, real-time anomaly detection system designed for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) with low-bandwidth constraints. Built for **Hack to the Future 2.0**, this project monitors network traffic, learns normal behavior patterns, detects anomalies (both operational and malicious), and generates contextual alerts through a clean, minimal dashboard.

## üöÄ Features

- üì° **Packet Capture & Parsing** using `scapy`
- üß† **Baseline Learning** with unsupervised ML (Isolation Forest)
- üîç **Anomaly Detection** in real-time or batch mode
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Alert Generation** with contextual metadata
- üìä **Web Dashboard** built with Flask for visualization
- ü™∂ **Lightweight & Efficient**, designed to run in low-bandwidth ICS environments

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

> Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network_anomaly_detector.git
cd network_anomaly_detector
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is empty, use:

```bash
pip install scapy pandas scikit-learn flask matplotlib joblib
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

### 1. Train the Model on Normal Data

```bash
python main.py
```

### 2. Start the Dashboard

```bash
python app/dashboard.py
```

Then, visit [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in your browser.

## üì¶ Datasets

You can use real or simulated traffic:

-   [TON_IoT Datasets](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/toniot-datasets)

-   [CIC-IDS 2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)

-   Custom .pcap files captured with Wireshark


---

## üåü Future Improvements

-   Live packet sniffing via `pyshark` or `libpcap`

-   Add auto-labeling with clustering (e.g., DBSCAN)

-   Edge compatibility (Raspberry Pi build)

-   Real-time email/SMS/Webhook alerts

-   Integration with InfluxDB + Grafana
